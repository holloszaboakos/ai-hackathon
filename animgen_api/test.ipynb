    "            \"content\": \"\"\"You are a masterful UX designer. Your job is to decide what kind of animations to prepare for an AI agent.\n",
    "First reason about the cues and functions the AI agent will perform.\n",
    "Then carefully design the AI agent's static description as a prompt to a text-to-image model, it should be a plain background, standing, distant, full body picture.\n",
    "Finally list the animations you want to generate for the AI agent including a short description, then a prompt for each animation.\n",
    "The AI's reactions should be expressive, exeggerated, and reactive to the user's possible inputs. Make sure to use deep emotional detail, as the video generator is relatively numb.\n",
    "Respond with a corresponding JSON object with the following structure:\n",
    "1. Reasoning about the AI agent's cues and functions. \n",
    "2. Static description of the AI agent. It should be a standing full body character. Choose the AI's voice (male, female, neutral) as well.\n",
    "3. List of animations with descriptions and prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation descriptions should be short and clear. The animation prompts should clearly define all intents in detail as well as directions (up, down, right, left) if relevant, and should be distinct from the others.\n",
    "Avoid designing directional cues, prefer emotions. You can only animate the character (or their possessions) as the webpage is static. The shopping section is to the left.\n",
    "Mandatory aspects of the animations: greeting, negative, positive feedback, thinking, surprise, celebration, other business-related and base emotions (such as disgust).\n",
